	title = {An architecture for intentional agents},
	copyright = {Unrestricted.},
	url = {https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/handle/2346/58449},
	abstract = {The goal of this research is to investigate the use of
Answer Set Prolog (ASP) based languages  and
action languages in the design and implementation of intelligent agents.
In particular we are interested in better understanding
an agent's intentions and how they are related to the
agent's beliefs, goals, and actions.
There has been substantial work on intentions
as part of a solution to a problem that is at the center of
intelligent behavior:  the problem of selecting the action to perform next.
We believe that an agent architecture that includes intentions
will allow us to improve the current methodology of ASP-based
agent design.
In this dissertation we will define an architecture
for the design and implementation of agents
whose behavior is determined by their intentions.

We divide this task into two parts.
The first is describing a model of an intentional
agent and its environment.
The second is to incorporate such a model into an architecture,
to formally describe reasoning tasks and behavior of intentional agents,
 and to create a prototype implementation.

The domain model is a transition diagram
whose nodes represent the mental state of the agent
and the physical state of the environment.
The former is described by a theory of intentions TI which is
independent from the description of the environment.
Both are described using action language AL
The agent's reasoning tasks include
explaining unexpected observations (diagnosis) and determining which
of his actions are intended at the present moment.
Intuitively, an intentional agent only attempts to
perform those actions that are intended and does so without delay.
We present a prototype implementation of the architecture based on
a refinement of the architecture in which
the reasoning tasks of the agent are reduced to computing answer sets of
programs constructed from the agent's knowledge.},

However, there still remains a large gap between theory and practice. The main reason for this has been the complexity of theorem-proving or model-checking in these expressive specification logics. Hence, the implemented BDI systems have tended to use the three major attitudes as data structures, rather than as modal operators. In this paper, we provide an alternative formalization of BDI agents by providing an operational and proof-theoretic semantics of a language AgentSpeak(L). This language can be viewed as an abstraction of one of the implemented BDI systems (i.e., PRS) and allows agent programs to be written and interpreted in a manner similar to that of horn-clause logic programs. We show how to perform derivations in this logic using a simple example. These derivations can then be used to prove the properties satisfied by BDI agents.},

	abstract = {Deductive question-answering systems generally evaluate queries under one of two possible assumptions which we in this paper refer to as the open and closed world assumptions. The open world assumption corresponds to the usual first order approach to query evaluation: Given a data base DB and a query Q, the only answers to Q are those which obtain from proofs of Q given DB as hypotheses. Under the closed world assumption, certain answers are admitted as a result of failure to find a proof. More specifically, if no proof of a positive ground literal exists, then the negation of that literal is assumed true. In this paper, we show that closed world evaluation of an arbitrary query may be reduced to open world evaluation of so-called atomic queries. We then show that the closed world assumption can lead to inconsistencies, but for Horn data bases no such inconsistencies can arise. Finally, we show how for Horn data bases under the closed world assumption purely negative clauses are irrelevant for deductive retrieval and function instead as integrity constraints.},

Autonomous goal-formation is described thanks to the interplay between existing (built-in) goals and new beliefs.

Applications range from small programs that intelligently search the Web buying and selling goods via electronic commerce, to autonomous space probes. This book focuses on the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model of rational agents, which recognizes the primacy of beliefs, desires, and intentions in rational action. The BDI model has three distinct strengths: an underlying philosophy based on practical reasoning in humans, a software architecture that is implementable in real systems, and a family of logics that support a formal theory of rational agency.The book introduces a BDI logic called LORA (Logic of Rational Agents). In addition to the BDI component, LORA contains a temporal component, which allows one to represent the dynamics of how agents and their environments change over time, and an action component, which allows one to represent the actions that agents perform and the effects of the actions. The book shows how LORA can be used to capture many components of a theory of rational agency, including such notions as communication and cooperation.},

For domains as diverse as rescue response, military, space, sports and collaboration between human workmates, flexible, dynamic coordination between cooperative agents needs to be achieved despite complex, uncertain, and hostile environments. There is now emerging consensus in the multiagent arena that for flexible teamwork among agents, each team member is provided with an explicit model of teamwork, which entails their commitments and responsibilities as a team member. This explicit modelling allows the coordination to be robust, despite individual failures and unpredictably changing environments.},

Then I consider an exemplar of a unified theory of cognition, namely, the Soar theory and system, which has been developed by my colleagues and myself over almost a decade. I will provide some historical context for Soar and then treat the Soar theory of cognition in somewhat greater detail, selecting several specific topics that should help to appreciate the nature of unified theories of cognition. At the end I will raise a number of general issues that apply concretely to Soar, but in fact apply in analogous form to any candidate unified theory of cognition. As will become apparent, the considerations stated here flow largely from my 1987 William James Lectures on Unified Theories of Cognition (Newell, 1990), but several new issues and results are incorporated.},

	abstract = {Psychology is now ready for unified theories of cognition--so says Allen Newell, a leading investigator in computer science and cognitive psychology. Not everyone will agree on a single set of mechanisms that will explain the full range of human cognition, but such theories are within reach and we should strive to articulate them. In this book, Newell makes the case for unified theories by setting forth a candidate. After reviewing the foundational concepts of cognitive science--knowledge, representation, computation, symbols, architecture, intelligence, and search--Newell introduces Soar, an architecture for general cognition. A pioneer system in artificial intelligence, Soar is the first problem solver to create its own subgoals and learn continuously from its own experience. Newell shows how Soar's ability to operate within the real-time constraints of intelligent behavior, such as immediate-response and item-recognition tasks, illustrates important characteristics of the human cognitive structure. Throughout, Soar remains an exemplar: we know only enough to work toward a fully developed theory of cognition, but Soar's success so far establishes the viability of the enterprise. Given its integrative approach, Unified Theories of Cognition will be of tremendous interest to researchers in a variety of fields, including cognitive science, artificial intelligence, psychology, and computer science. This exploration of the nature of mind, one of the great problems of philosophy, should also transcend disciplines and attract a large scientific audience.},

	abstract = {Process compliance measurement is getting increasing attention in companies due to stricter legal requirements and market pressure for operational excellence. In order to judge on compliance of the business processing, the degree of behavioural deviation of a case, i.e., an observed execution sequence, is quantified with respect to a process model (referred to as fitness, or recall). Recently, different compliance measures have been proposed. Still, nearly all of them are grounded on state-based techniques and the trace equivalence criterion, in particular. As a consequence, these approaches have to deal with the state explosion problem. In this paper, we argue that a behavioural abstraction may be leveraged to measure the compliance of a process log – a collection of cases. To this end, we utilise causal behavioural profiles that capture the behavioural characteristics of process models and cases, and can be computed efficiently. We propose different compliance measures based on these profiles, discuss the impact of noise in process logs on our measures, and show how diagnostic information on non-compliance is derived. As a validation, we report on findings of applying our approach in a case study with an international service provider.},

On the basis of defeasible logic and argumentation, this paper proposes an autonomous, normative and guidable agent model, called ANGLE, to cope with these challenges. This agent is established by combining beliefs–desires–intentions (BDI) architecture with policy-based method and the mechanism of contract-based coordination. Its architecture, knowledge representation, as well as reasoning and decision-making, are presented in this paper. ANGLE is characteristic of the following three aspects. First, both its motivational knowledge and informational knowledge are changeable, and allowed to be incomplete, inconsistent/conflicting. Second, its knowledge is represented in terms of extended defeasible logic with modal operators. Different from the existing defeasible theories, its theories (including belief theory, goal theory and intention theory) are dynamic (called dynamic theories), reflecting the variations of observations and external motivational knowledge. Third, its reasoning and decision-making are based on argumentation. Due to the dynamics of underlying theories, argument construction is not a monotonic process, which is different from the existing argumentation framework where arguments are constructed incrementally.},

An essential goal in reasoning is to reach conclusions which can be justified. However, since justification does not necessarily guarantee truth, the best we can do is to derive “plausible/ tentative” conclusions from partial and conflicting information. Policies are typically expressed as rules that could be complex and include timing constraints. Complex sets of access policies can contain conflicts e.g., a rule allows access while another rule prevents it. In this paper, we aim at providing a formalism for specifying authorization policies of a dynamic system. We present a temporal defeasible logic (TDL) which allows us to specify temporal policies and to handle conflicts. It can be shown that the proposed model is a generalization of the role-based access control model.},

 into two parts: theory and structure. A theory consists of one or more modules with a common theme, possibly organized into a module hierarchy based on a dependency relation. It contains declarations of sorts, attributes, and properties of the domain together with axioms describing them. Structures are used to describe the domain's objects. These features, together with the means for defining classes of a domain as special cases of previously defined ones, facilitate the stepwise development, testing, and readability of a knowledge base, as well as the creation of knowledge representation libraries.},

	abstract = {The need for coordination among autonomous entities is common in dynamically changing domains. One such domain is the coordination of components in distributed component architectures. In these architectures, asynchronous communication is used to ensure autonomy. Management systems that control such architectures must respect this autonomy by decentralizing interaction policies and control. Middle agents (Decker et al., 1997) have been introduced as brokers or mediators in such dynamic settings. Rule-driven coordination (RDC) agents are middle agents that act as brokers to the individual components in component architectures. These RDC agents encapsulate the interaction policy definition (rules) and the aspects of communication, data management, and policy execution. This paper defines each of these aforementioned aspects of the RDC agents. Furthermore, there is the use of RDC agents to manage a workflow of Java-based components in a typical electronic commerce domain.},

	title = {An architecture for authorization and delegation in distributed object-oriented agent systems},
	abstract = {Public key infrastructures and authentication protocols, in the sense they are currently known, have been publicly studied since 1978 [23]. In this work I demonstrate how I, together with the research group I have had the privilege to direct, have further developed these concepts in the Object-Oriented field. In our research, we have implemented a public key based system that allows distributed agents to securely co-operate in an insecure network.
In this thesis, I focus on the following four interrelated aspects. First, I define a concrete secure software architecture for distributed software agents. Second, I describe our implementation of an Object-Oriented protocol framework for cryptographic protocols. Third, I show how an authorization based Public Key Infrastructure can be used to manage the security of Java based, Object-Oriented software Agents. And finally, I describe how this infrastructure can be extended to support distributed, secure agent execution and permission delegation. In the work as a whole, my goal has been an open, extensible security architecture that allows distributed software agents to co-operate securely. In this context, security1 mainly means two things. First, the agents must be able to trust in the underlying computing machinery, and also trust in each other. Second, the agents must be able to delegate rights among themselves, and to create secure connections between any two communicating agents.
The distributed secure software architecture can be considered a high level framework where the protocol framework and the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) plug in. It defines the security related subsystems for typical Object-Oriented execution environments, focusing on distribution and thereby cryptographic means of implementing security. The Object-Oriented protocol framework provides a supportive base, on top of which various cryptographic protocols can be built. In this sense, cryptographic protocols include both session encryption protocols used to protect actual data traffic between communicating parties and key management and authentication protocols, used to create secure channels used for the actual data transfer.
The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is needed to provide sufficient trust relationships and an initial security context to the communicating parties so that the authentication and key management protocols can be operated. In this work, my sole focus has been on an authorization based (as opposed to identity based) PKI. In practical terms, this means that the secure channels created within such an authorization framework automatically get strong relationship semantics, providing the communicating parties explicit information about the level and form of trust mediated.
Finally, the architecture with its protocol and PKI components makes it possible to create Object-Oriented software agents, distribute them into the network, and let them collaborate in a secure way. In our system, agents are represented as collections (JAR packages) of Java classes. The agent code may be loaded into a trusted Java Virtual Machine, where it is run. The running agents are able to create and evaluate trust relationships between each other, allowing dynamic delegation and creation of secure communication channels.},

In order to overcome this limitation, we extend the class of general logic programs by including classical negation, in addition to negation-as-failure. The semantics of such extended programs is based on the method of stable models. The concept of a disjunctive database can be extended in a similar way. We show that some facts of commonsense knowledge can be represented by logic programs and disjunctive databases more easily when classical negation is available. Computationally, classical negation can be eliminated from extended programs by a simple preprocessor. Extended programs are identical to a special case of default theories in the sense of Reiter.},

We also discuss the complexity of reasoning tasks based on LPODs and possible applications.},

Despite the high expressiveness of DLP, there are some simple properties, often arising in real-world applications, which cannot be encoded in a simple and natural manner. Among these, properties requiring to apply some arithmetic operators (like sum, times, count) on a set of elements satisfying some conditions, cannot be naturally expressed in DLP. To overcome this deficiency, in this paper we extend DLP by aggregate functions. We formally define the semantics of the new language, named DLP- 4. We show the usefulness of the new constructs on relevant knowledge-based problems. We analyze the computational complexity of DLP \&quot; 4, showing that the addition of aggregates does not bring a higher cost in that respect. We provide an implementation of the DLP- 4 language in DLV- the state-of-theart DLP system- and report on experiments which confirm the usefulness of the proposed extension also for the efficiency of the computation.},

	abstract = {Recently, logic programs under the stable model semantics, have emerged as a new paradigm for declarative programming. In this new approach, a logic program is used to represent the knowledge of the domain, and various tasks are reduced to computing the stable models of this program. This paradigm has been successfully used in a wide range of applications including planning, diagnostics, graph problems, etc. The basic algorithm for computing stable models is implemented by several efficient systems. The most efficient implementation to date is called Smodels. Even though Smodels was demonstrated to be capable of solving several large industrial problems, there are some simple logic programs for which Smodels' performance is unexpectedly slow. This problem is not related to the implementation. Rather, it is the result of the one rule at a time inference used by the basic algorithm. The goal of this work is to improve the efficiency of the basic algorithm extending the set of inference rules with a new rule called the Extended Evaluation Rule (EER). EER efficiently retrieves information spread across several rules of a program. An algorithm, newsmodels, was developed incorporating the EER. A system Surya, based on the newsmodels algorithm was implemented. It was found that the EER considerably improves the efficiency of the system.},

First, the operation of PDC-agent is based on an event-driven mechanism. Various events drive the components of the interpreter. Second, the representation of PDC-agent is on the basis of ontology.},

	abstract = {Methodological Guidelines for Modeling and Developing MAS-Based Simulations  The intersection of agents, modeling, simulation, and application domains has been the subject of active research for over two decades. Although agents and simulation have been used effectively in a variety of application domains, much of the supporting research remains scattered in the literature, too often leaving scientists to develop multi-agent system (MAS) models and simulations from scratch.   Multi-Agent Systems: Simulation and Applications provides an overdue review of the wide ranging facets of MAS simulation, including methodological and application-oriented guidelines. This comprehensive resource reviews two decades of research in the intersection of MAS, simulation, and different application domains. It provides scientists and developers with disciplined engineering approaches to modeling and developing MAS-based simulations. After providing an overview of the field’s history and its basic principles, as well as cataloging the various simulation engines for MAS, the book devotes three sections to current and emerging approaches and applications.  Simulation for MAS — explains simulation support for agent decision making, the use of simulation for the design of self-organizing systems, the role of software architecture in simulating MAS, and the use of simulation for studying learning and stigmergic interaction.  MAS for Simulation — discusses an agent-based framework for symbiotic simulation, the use of country databases and expert systems for agent-based modeling of social systems, crowd-behavior modeling, agent-based modeling and simulation of adult stem cells, and agents for traffic simulation.   Tools — presents a number of representative platforms and tools for MAS and simulation, including Jason, James II, SeSAm, and RoboCup Rescue.  Complete with over 200 figures and formulas, this reference book provides the necessary overview of experiences with MAS simulation and the tools needed to exploit simulation in MAS for future research in a vast array of applications including home security, computational systems biology, and traffic management.},

Lin and Zhao [7] showed that for non-tight programs the models of completion which do not correspond to answer sets can be eliminated by adding to the completion what they called “loop formulas”. Nevertheless, their solver assat has some disadvantages: it can work only with basic rules, and it can compute only one answer set. Answer set solver cmodels-1 [12] is a system that computes answer sets for logic programs that are tight or can be transformed into tight programs, and does not suffer from these limitations.},

	abstract = {The process of introducing new public policies is a complex one in the sense that the behavior of society at the macro-level depends directly on the individual behavior of the people in that society and ongoing dynamics of the environment. It is at the micro-level that change is initiated, that policies effectively change the behavior of individuals. Since macro-models do not suffice, science has turned to develop and study agent-based simulations, i.e., micro-level models. In correspondence with the good scientific practice of parsimony, current ABSS models are based on agents with simple cognitive capabilities. However, the societies being modeled in policy making relate to real people with real needs and personalities, often of a multi-cultural composition. Those circumstances require the agents to be diversified to accommodate these facts.In this positioning paper, we propose an incrementally complex model for agent reasoning that can describe the influence of policies or comparable external influences on the behavior of agents. Starting from the BDI model for agent reasoning, we discuss the effect when personality and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs are added to the model. Finally, we extend the model with a component that captures the cultural background and normative constitution of the agent.In the paper we show how these extensions affect the filtering of the desires and intentions of the agent and the willingness of the agent to modify its behavior in face of a new policy. This way, simulations can be made that support the differentiation of behaviors in multi-cultural societies, and thus can be made to support policy makers in their decisions.},
