% \section{Future Work}

In this proposal, we have surveyed different agent architectures ranging from production rule systems, logic-based architectures (such as BDI architectures), and those with normative models and cognitive models.
The focus of this work has been on modern logic-based architectures.
We began by introducing transitions systems, which model the agent's environment like a directed graph of states.
Then we discussed the development of a formal syntax that specifies transition systems.
Next, we introduced the AAA agent architecture.
While the AAA architecture is goal-oriented and uses information encoded in an action language to achieve them, it does not persist a plan across iterations of its control loop.
This is deemed a limitation and prompts the creation of the $\mathcal{AIA}$ architecture.

The $\mathcal{AIA}$ architecture represents an agent's mental state as properties of the world that are internal to the agent.
The $\mathcal{AIA}$ architecture then uses this mental state to persist an agent's plans (which are encapsulated in a construct called an activity) as well as its current progress in executing them.
The agent's mental state is maintained by a set of logic rules called the Theory of Intentions ($\mathcal{TI}$).
We then provided the $\mathcal{AIA}$ control loop and explained its execution through the aid of a few examples.

We introduced languages $\mathcal{APL}$ and $\mathcal{AOPL}$ to represent and reason over action compliance given authorization and obligation policies.
While $\mathcal{APL}$ and $\mathcal{AOPL}$ are not action languages, they share a similar syntax to that of action language AL and work in tandem with it.
We demonstrated the implementation of $\mathcal{APL}$ and $\mathcal{AOPL}$ using clingo with a varying degree of knowledge, ranging from a full knowledge of fluents to an initial understanding of fluents coupled with an event history.

We then contrasted the $\mathcal{AIA}$ agent architecture and $\mathcal{AOPL}$ to the PDC-agent architecture.
One feature of the PDC-agent architecture is that it supports multi-agent cooperation.
PDC-agent also shares a similar mechanism to $\mathcal{TI}$ for updating beliefs via internal actions.
However, the PDC-agent architecture requires enumerating plans by hand and annotating which goals they achieve.
Since the $\mathcal{AIA}$ architecture is based on action languages, plans can be automatically generated, and their respective end-goal can be computed.

We propose to extend the $\mathcal{AIA}$ architecture so that it can reason over $\mathcal{AOPL}$ policies.
This new agent architecture will be called the $\mathcal{APIA}$ architecture.
In addition to its formal definition and implementation, we propose to construct examples on which $\mathcal{APIA}$ can be evaluated.
The evaluation of $\mathcal{APIA}$ will also consist of the expressivity of its syntax, its elaboration tolerance, its difficulty of construction, and its run-time performance.
Due to performance improvements in underlying ASP solvers, we propose to update Blount's implementation of the $\mathcal{AIA}$ architecture from CR-Models2 to clingo so that differences in performance are meaningful.

The $\mathcal{APIA}$ agent architecture would be a modern logic-based architecture that is able to plan amid changing environments while maintaining policy compliance.
As a result, its behavior is both explainable and ensured to be compliant.
Such properties the $\mathcal{APIA}$ a significant contribution to the logic programming community.
