% \section{Future Work}

In this paper, we have surveyed different agent architectures ranging from production rule systems, logic-based architectures (such as BDI architectures), and those with normative models and cognitive models.
The focus of this work has been on modern logic-based architectures.
We began by introducing transitions systems, which model the agent’s environment like a directed graph of states.
Then we discussed the development of a formal syntax that specifies transition systems.
Next, we introduced the AAA agent architecture.
While the AAA architecture is goal-oriented and uses information encoded in an action language to achieve them, it does not persist a plan across iterations of its control loop.
This is deemed a limitation and prompts the creation of the $\mathcal{AIA}$ architecture.

The $\mathcal{AIA}$ architecture represents an agent’s mental state as properties of the world that are internal to the agent.
The $\mathcal{AIA}$ architecture then uses this mental state to persist an agent’s plans (which are encapsulated in a construct called an activity) as well as its current progress in executing them.
The agent’s mental state is maintained by a set of logic rules called the Theory of Intentions ($\mathcal{TI}$).
We then provided the $\mathcal{AIA}$ control loop and explained its execution through the aid of a few examples.

To conclude, there has been significant research towards designing different agent architectures.
This paper has focused on the $\mathcal{AIA}$ agent architecture and we plan to build upon it in future work.
