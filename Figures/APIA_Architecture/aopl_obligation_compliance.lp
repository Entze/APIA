% Iff [for all obl(Action, Timestep), occurs(Action, Timestep) is true]
% and [for all obl(-Action, Timestep), occurs(Action, Timestep) is false],
%      then we are compliant

% Inverse:

%  or [there exists obl(Action, Timestep), occurs(Action, Timestep) is not false],
%      then we are not compliant

% Break apart:
% If [there exists obl(Action, Timestep), occurs(Action, Timestep) is not true],
%     then we are not compliant.
% If [there exists obl(Action, Timestep), occurs(Action, Timestep) is not false],
%     then we are not compliant.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Sanity Checks %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% An obligation policy cannot be contradictory
