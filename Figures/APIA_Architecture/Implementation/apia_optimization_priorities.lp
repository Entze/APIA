% Ensure all of these values are higher than all other priority values used in the ASP program

% Currently, clingo 5.4.0 uses a signed 32-integer to represent numbers.
% Thus, (2 ** 32) / 2 - 1 == 2147483647 should be the highest number supported by the grounder.
% This number is unlikely to be used elsewhere in the program.
