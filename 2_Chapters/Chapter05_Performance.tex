In this chapter, we detail our performance benchmark between our update to Blount's AIA implementation and our APIA implementation.
The purpose of this experiment is to show the computational overhead reasoning over policies incurs over the AIA architecture.

The design of the experiment is as follows.
Over many repeated trials, we run the APIA control loop implementation with ...
